# 🌀 Asynchronous FIFO – Verilog

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of an **Asynchronous FIFO** along with a testbench and simulation waveform.


## 📁 Files Included

- `fifo_buffer.v` – Asynchronous FIFO RTL
- `fifo_buffer_tb.v` – Testbench
- `async_waveform.png` – ModelSim waveform output


## 📊 Simulation Waveform

Below is the waveform obtained from ModelSim simulation:

## 📌 Notes

- Design written and simulated using **ModelSim**
- FIFO tested for write and read synchronization across two clock domains
